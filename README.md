Dataset: Mice Protein Expression Dataset
This dataset was generated from experiments aimed at understanding the impacts of Down Syndrome on 
learning through analysis of protein expression in mice. Protein expression is disrupted by human trisomy 21
(presence of an additional 21 chromosome), leading to the physical and intellectual manifestations associated 
with DS. 
A mouse genome was successfully manipulated to produce several models of DS in rodents, known as 
'Ts65Dn'. In generating the 'Mice Protein Expression Data Set', Ts65Dn and normal mice were split in 
experimental and control groups and exposed to a range of variables. The rodents were then euthanized, and 
their cortex protein levels were analysed in a quantitative fashion. 
The data set consists of the expression levels of 77 proteins that produced detectable signals in the nuclear 
fraction of the cortex. There are 38 control mice and 34 trisomic mice (Down syndrome), for a total of 72 
mice. In the experiments, 15 measurements were registered of each protein per mouse. Each measurement 
can be considered as an independent mouse. The eight classes of mice are described based on the features 
genotype, behavior and treatment. According to genotype, mice can be control or trisomic. According to 
behavior, some mice have been stimulated to learn (context-shock) and others have been not (shockcontext). To assess the effect of the drug memantine in recovering the ability to learn in trisomic mice, some 
mice have been injected with the drug and others have been not.
